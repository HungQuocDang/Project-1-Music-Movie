# MEDIA-UNIVERSE

## DESCRIPTION
Media universe is a developed web browser that uses the OMDB API for movies and the Spotify API for music. When opening the web browser, users can log in on the LoginPage if they already have a login ID. Otherwise, they will be redirected to the Signup page to create an account. Once the account is created, users can browse through different categories of movies and music according to their preferences.

## USAGE
In the movies browser, users can search for any movie by entering its name. The browser will display various options of movies with their images and titles. When users click on a title, they will be redirected to the Google browser for that movie, where they can find information about the movie's cast, roles, and more. If users wish to add a movie to their favorite list, they can do so by clicking on the heart icon, which will turn red. Similarly, they can remove a movie from their favorites by clicking on the heart icon again, causing it to turn black.

In the music browser, users can also search for albums, artists, or songs by entering their names. The browser will display the top nine options related to the search, along with their images and titles. Clicking on any image in the browser will redirect users to the Spotify page for that particular item, where they can actually play the song. If users want to add a song to their favorite list, they can click on the heart icon.
